<main>
<p>The internet is a rapidly changing, highly complex, and deeply embedded system in our every day lives. It also has a growing carbon footprint, a lack of accessibility for users with disabilities, and feels increasingly dense and homogeneous. This course explores the generative possibilities and creative potential available within new alternatives and imaginative solutions to some of these challenges. We will learn a lot about all of the infrastructure that lies behind the web we interact with on a daily basis. And we will develop our projects --> <b id="yellow">websites, ux/ui designs, info graphics, zines, and more</b><-- in response to this research. While utilizing the guideposts of focused critique, design limitations, and creative constraints, the work in this course will be devoted to countering the concerning aspects of the internet and will be spent examining sustainability and accessibility enabling practices necessary to the future of this essential tool. And we will make fun and interesting projects while we are at it.</p>

<p id="highlight"><b>Slow Internet is a studio class that will focus on important questions of the technological systems that make up our most fundamental infrastructure in the 21st century.</b></p>
