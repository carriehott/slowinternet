   <p>Earth Camp is an interdisciplinary project exploring earth-based intelligence inherent in natural systems as a foundation for speculative infrastructural proposals. The project is a critical response to the growing focus on space exploration and the concurrent militarization and privatization of space. Instead of space camp, which focuses on rocket science, robotics, and artificial intelligence, Earth Camp offers a counterpoint rooted in the inherent wisdom of terrestrial </p>
   <p>In it's first loose form, Earth Camp will be a weekend long gathering in August 2025 exploring horizontal infrastructure through radio, solar-powered servers, and community networking.

    🌎 what are we doing 🌏
    <p>The intention of this convening is to provide people with a place to rest, slow down, work on something, meet other folks working on similar types of projects, and discuss strategies around horizontal infrastructure. There will be a loose ‘camp’ structure—we will structure with your input once we confirm participants—with periods of collective activity, discussion, meals, and a chance for folks to slow down in their own way. Deurendis offers many spots to hide out, be solo, inside or outside, along with a pond, woods, firepit, a big sky, and a big view.
